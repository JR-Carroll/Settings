# Original ideas for this came from:
# http://gledovic.com/ignore-files-with-gitignore-and-global-gitignore
#
# How to setup:
# Step1:  Create this file and place it in a global directory of your choosing!
# Step2:  Add this file to your git global config by typing:
#         git config --global core.excludefile /path_you_picked/.file_name
# Step3:  Add file names and file extensions to this file that you want ignored!

# Eclipse Standard Ignores
